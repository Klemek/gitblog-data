# How I almost satisfied my craving for statistics

![thumbnail](thumbnail.jpg)

First of all, I'm not a data scientist nor in a data related job. I'm your everyday statistics enjoyer and as so, I like getting useless information about everyday things like: a too precise number of my footsteps, how many strangers visited my LinkedIn profile or [when the date and time matches a prime number](https://twitter.com/date_prime?lang=fr).

Recently, I've been wondering about online chatting. When talking to friends for a long time, you kind of want to know who talks the most, what is the busiest hour or when was the longest break.

Fortunately, I mostly talk to my friends on Discord, which provides me with some useful query tools where I can specify some filters: from who, containing what, in which conversation, etc.

*Discord provides users with a powerful query system*

While it's already superior to what can provide other platforms like Messenger, I felt the craving for **more** data. There should be a point where you have too much information to handle and you feel satisfied.

So I got to work.

**TODO**
