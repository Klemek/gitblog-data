## Introduction

First of all, I'm not a data scientist nor in a data related job. I'm your everyday statistics enjoyer and as so, I like getting useless information about everyday things like: a too precise number of my footsteps, how many strangers visited my LinkedIn profile or [when the date and time matches a prime number](https://twitter.com/date_prime?lang=fr).

Recently, I've been wondering about online chatting. When talking to friends for a long time, you kind of want to know who talks the most, what is the busiest hour or when was the longest break.

Fortunately, I mostly talk to my friends on Discord, which provides me with some useful query tools where I can specify some filters: from who, containing what, in which conversation, etc.

*Discord provides users with a powerful query system*

While it's already superior to what can provide other platforms like Messenger, I felt the craving for **more** data. There should be a point where you have too much information to handle and you feel satisfied.

So I got to work.

## Breakdown of the project

Intrested in the result and not the process? You can [jump to the end](#results) if you're tired of reading.

Discord has a wonderful native integration for bots which comes with an easy-to-use API in several languages. I already had a wrapper on the Python API that I called [miniscord](https://github.com/klemek/miniscord). This project allows a head start to make bots by simplifying the syntax. It comes with tools to help you register commands and handling them easily.
